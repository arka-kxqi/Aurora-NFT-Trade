## Why **Aurora-NFT-Trade**?

**Aurora-NFT-Trade** stands out by offering users the ability to engage with NFTs in ways never before possible on the **Euclid "Aurora" Testnet**. By introducing liquid staking, the platform removes the traditional barriers of illiquidity in NFT ownership. Users are no longer bound by the limitations of locked assets and can freely trade or stake NFTs while still benefiting from the rewards and utility that DeFi brings to the table.

Our vision is to merge the best of NFTs and DeFi, creating a platform where users can:

- **Earn while trading**: By introducing staking mechanisms, users can earn rewards while engaging in the marketplace.
- **Access DeFi with NFTs**: NFTs are no longer just collectibles; they can now serve as collateral or yield-bearing assets within decentralized finance.
- **Cross-chain NFT Marketplace**: As the Euclid blockchain expands, we aim to integrate IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), allowing NFTs from different chains within the Cosmos ecosystem to be traded seamlessly.
